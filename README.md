# Aurora Borealis 

![Am I responsive image](readme-assets/am-i-responsive.jpg)

<hr>

With this site, I wanted to give users who are interested a brief overview of this natural phenomenon. The user will find the scientific explanation of how it arises, some fun facts and a contact page should they wish to get more information about the phenomenon. The live site can be found [here](https://carinaaj.github.io/ms1-aurora-borealis/).

# Design

Text & Background color

Despite the Aurora Borealis being a very visual topic I decided to only implement hero banners as visuals to catch the users interest from the moment they enter the 
site. To soften the contrast but still highlight the colorful hero banners I chose a light grey color as background color. Apart from the logo and navigation menu
the text color is black. As black was a bit too harsh as header I decided to go for a very dark blue color instead.

Hover/Input Border Color

As the most common colour for the Aurora is green I decided to color pick a light turquoise from the first hero banner and use it as hover color for all links together
with an appropriate transition duration.

This color can also be found as the border around the input fields on the contact page.

# Features

**Existing Features:**

1. Navigation Bar

To provide the user with easy navigation across all three pages, the header includes the navigation bar at the top right hand corner and the logo ‘Aurora Borealis’ in the top left corner, which creates some space in between both, as well as making it clear on first sight what the site is about and where the navigation can be found. The navigation bar is made out of the Home, Fun Fact and Contact page.

Landing Page aurora banner

Each page consists of a different hero banner to show the variety of the Aurora and keep the interest of the user rather than using the same image across all pages. In addition it should also intrigue the user to learn more about it and to go through all three pages.

Landing Page (Main Section)

This page provides a brief explanation about 1) What the Aurora Borealis is 2) Where the best places are to see it and 3) When the best time to see it is

Whilst the explanations are relatively brief, there is still a paragraph break in each section to make it easier to read. Every question (and answer) has been separated with its own textbox for easy reading and without overwhelming the user with one large paragraph of text. 

![What is the Aurora?](readme-assets/what-is-aurora.jpg)

After the first question there is a short Youtube video of 4 min also answering the question ‘What is an aurora’ to provide the user not only with textual content but also with a visual.

The second section follows the same scheme. First a brief explanation, followed by a Youtube video for some visuals.

Despite being one of the more common questions regarding the Aurora ("When is the best time to see it?"), this section is only a paragraph in length with no supporting YouTube video. However, to make it clearer at first glance what the question is about I decided to add a little calendar icon next to the question, which offers quicker visual context.

4. Footer

The footer section features links to four social media sites and upon clicking, a new tab will open.

Fun Facts (second page)

![Second hero banner](readme-assets/second-aurora-banner.jpg)

To provide some less scientific and more fun information to the use I decided to add some fun facts about the Aurora on this page. 

**Introduction:**

As this page does not contain any visuals I decided to add some calmin, subject-appropriate music instead, whilst reading more about the Aurora. The Track is called ‘Northern Lights’ and has been written specifically for this project.

To follow the same style in layout as the main page, I separated each fun fact in it’s own textbox and also used paragraph breaks where necessary to make it easier to read.

![Fun fact section](readme-assets/fun-facts.jpg)

The last textbox makes the user aware that there are live cam links available where the Aurora can be seen from the comfort of their own home. Three links have been provided which all open in a new tab. To keep the same colour scheme the hover colour is the same as the social media links.

Contact (third page)

This page allows the user to leave some details, should they wish to receive a monthly newsletter about the Aurora Borealis. All input fields have a border around which is the same turquoise colour which has been used for the social media links hover. The submit button has also been supplied with the same background colour when hovering over it.

![Contact form](readme-assets/contact-form.jpg)

Upon submitting the form the user will be redirected to a new page, which will thank him for signing up and if he left a comment someone will respond in 48 hrs.

# Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Validator Testing

HTML
No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator

CSS
No errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator
Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

Deployment


The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab.

On the left-hand side under ‘Code and automation’, select ‘Pages’ and from the 

source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch.

Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
