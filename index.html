            <h3>What is the Aurora Borealis?</h3><br>
            <p>The bright dancing lights of the aurora are actually collisions between electrically charged
                particles
                from the sun that enter the earth's atmosphere. The lights are seen above the magnetic poles of the
                northern and southern hemispheres. They are known as 'Aurora borealis' in the north and 'Aurora
                australis' in the south.

                Auroral displays appear in many colours although pale green and pink are the most common. Shades of
                red,
                yellow, green, blue, and violet have been reported. The lights appear in many forms from patches or
                scattered clouds of light to streamers, arcs, rippling curtains or shooting rays that light up the
                sky with an eerie glow.

            <h3>Where are the best places to see the Aurora?</h3><br>
            <p>Because the phenomena occurs near the magnetic poles, northern lights have been seen as far south as New
                Orleans in the western hemisphere, while similar locations in the east never experience the mysterious
                lights. However the best places to watch the lights (in North America) are in the northwestern parts of
                Canada, particularly the Yukon, Nunavut, Northwest Territories and Alaska.

                Auroral displays can also be seen over the southern tip of Greenland and Iceland, the northern coast of
                Norway and over the coastal waters north of Siberia. Southern auroras are not often seen as they are
                concentrated in a ring around Antarctica and the southern Indian Ocean.

                Areas that are not subject to 'light pollution' are the best places to watch for the lights. Areas in
                the north, in smaller communities, tend to be best.
