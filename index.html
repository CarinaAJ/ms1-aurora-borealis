            <h3>What is the Aurora Borealis?</h3><br><br>
            <p> The lights we see in the night sky are caused by activity on the surface of the Sunn.
                Solar storms on our star's surface give out huge clouds of electricaly charged particles.
                These particles can travel million of miles, and some may eventually collide with the Earth.

                Most of these particles are deflected away, but some become captured in the Earth’s magnetic field,
                accelerating down towards the north and south poles into the atmosphere. This is why aurora activity
                is concentrated at the magnetic poles.

                “These particles then slam into atoms and molecules in the Earth’s atmosphere and essentially heat
                them up,” explains Royal Observatory
                astronomer Tom Kerss. “We call this physical process ‘excitation’, but it’s very much like heating a
                gas and making it glow.” <br><br>
                What we are seeing therefore are atoms and molecules in our atmosphere colliding with particles from
                the Sun.
                The aurora's characteristic wavy patterns and 'curtains' of light are caused by the lines of force
                in the Earth’s magnetic field.

                The lowest part of an aurora is typically around 80 miles above the Earth's surface. However, the
                top of a display may extend several
                thousand miles above the Earth.

                Different gases give off different colours when they are heated. The same process is also taking
                place in the aurora.
                The two primary gases in the Earth’s atmosphere are nitrogen and oxygen, and these elements give off
                different colours during an aurora display.

                The green we see in the aurora is characteristic of oxygen, while hints of purple, blue or pink are
                caused by nitrogen.

                “We sometimes see a wonderful scarlet red colour, and this is caused by very high altitude oxygen
                interacting with solar particles,” adds astronomer Tom.
                “This only occurs when the aurora is particularly energetic.”

            <h3>Where are the best places to see the Aurora? </h3><br><br>
            <p>Northern Lights can be seen in the northern or southern hemisphere, in an irregularly shaped oval centred
                over each magnetic pole.
                The lights are known as 'Aurora borealis' in the north and 'Aurora australis' in the south. Scientists
                have learned that in most instances
                northern and southern auroras are mirror-like images that occur at the same time, with similar shapes
                and colors.

                Because the phenomena occurs near the magnetic poles, northern lights have been seen as far south as New
                Orleans in the western hemisphere, while similar locations in the east never experience the mysterious
                lights. However the best places to watch the lights (in North America) are in the northwestern parts of
                Canada, particularly the Yukon, Nunavut, Northwest Territories and Alaska.<br><br>

                Auroral displays can also be seen over the southern tip of Greenland and Iceland, the northern coast of
                Norway and over the coastal waters north of Siberia. Southern auroras are not often seen as they are
                concentrated in a ring around Antarctica and the southern Indian Ocean.

                Areas that are not subject to 'light pollution' are the best places to watch for the lights. Areas in
                the north, in smaller communities, tend to be best.

            <h3>When is the best time to see the Aurora? <i class="fa-solid fa-calendar-days"></i></h3><br><br>
            <p>
                The aurora borealis are potentially visible under dark skies from late August to mid-April preferably
                under a clear, cloudless sky.
                While they occur year round they are weaker than sunlight and therefore sightings aren’t possible from
                May to July and for most of August.

                Spring and autumn generally provide more stable weather conditions and milder temperatures plus there is
                greater aurora activity around the equinoxes.
                November through to February offer the darkest skies and longer evenings for maximum sky-gazing.<br><br>
                The strongest lights tend to appear between 9pm and 2am, though the best sightings often occur between
                11pm and midnight.
                Between 4am and 5pm there is generally too much daylight to see the aurora – exceptions are the darkest
                months of the year and higher latitudes such Svalbard,
                where it is dark 24/7 from mid-Nov to end of Jan.
