            <h4>You'll find them in cave paintings</h4><br>
            <p>
                The earliest depiction of the Northern Lights may be in the cave paintings of Cro-Magnon man, in about
                30,000 BC.

            <h4>You can see them from space</h4><br>
            <p>Astronauts on the International Space Station will sometimes pass through the aurora borealis while in
                orbit.
                While most displays of the Northern Lights appear between 90-130km above the Earth’s surface, they can
                reach up to 600km into space.
                The International Space Station orbits at an altitude of 408km.

            <h4>They can be disruptive</h4><br>
            <p>The solar flare that created the solar storm of 1859 was of such magnitude that the Northern Lights were
                visible as far south as Mexico, Cuba and Hawaii.
                Telegraph systems all over Europe and North America failed, and telegraph operators reported receiving
                electric shocks. <br><br>A similar storm hitting Earth today
                could potentially cause mass disruption to global communication systems. The Solar Storm of 2012 was
                thought to be of a comparable magnitude but the solar wind
                from it missed the Earth.

            <h4>You shouldn’t whistle at them</h4><br>
            <p>The Sami people are indigenous to Norway, Sweden, northern Finland and the north-west region of Russia
                known as the Murmansk Oblast.
                They believe that that the Northern Lights emanate from the souls of their dead ancestors and must be
                treated with immense respect.
                They fear that to whistle in their presence might result in the whistler being spirited away.

            <h4>Green is always the most frequent colour seen</h4><br>
            <p>The majority of solar particles collide with our atmosphere at an altitude of around 60 to 150 miles and
                it’s here where the oxygen causes the Aurora
                to appear in green. <br><br>Couple this with the fact that the human eye is most able to identify the
                colour
                green and it’s no surprise that this is the most
                dominant colour we associate with the Northern Lights Above 150 miles, where the solar particles react
                with Oxygen at higher altitudes, red light becomes visible.

            <h4>Other planets also have auroras</h4><br>
            <p>The aurora are not unique to Earth!<br><br> Both Jupiter and Saturn have stronger magnetic fields and
                auroras
                have been observed on both gas planets.
                We know this from the Hubble Space Telescope and the Cassini and Galileo spacecraft.
                Just like on Earth, the aurora on Saturn seem to be caused by the solar wind. However, the causes of
                Jupiter's aurora are more complex.

            <h4>Both the north and the south pole are needed</h4><br>
            <p>The Earth’s magnetic field is an invisible shield around the Earth created by magnetic forces flowing
                from the South Pole to the North Pole.
                This magnetic field protects the Earth from the solar wind by stopping it striking Earth
                directly.<br><br>
                It diverts the solar wind around the Earth,
                but as the solar wind’s magnetic field meets the Earth’s magnetic field on the dark side of the Earth,
                pointing away from the Sun, the fields merge
                and some of the charged particles are funnelled back towards the poles where they meet the Earth’s upper
                atmosphere.<br><br>
                This funnelling happens towards both North and South Poles, creating both the Northern Lights, or aurora
                borealis, and the southern loights, or aurora australis.
